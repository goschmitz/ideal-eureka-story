I was blinded by the sunlight that awoke me as I fought to sit upright. A combination of sand and dried blood was stuck to the right side of my face. The last thing I remembered was being thrown overboard as a wave capsized my fishing boat.I guess I should be lucky that I didn't end up at the bottom of the ocean with my ship, but something tells me that being alone on an island with nothing but the couple of fishing lewers I found in my soggy vest pocket isn't much better.
